''' explanation for generate_slowdown_multiplier:
We want to make sure someone who enters the same road 1 minute after you cannot
exit the road BEFORE you.

let SM_t be the Speed Multiplier - the value by which we divide max_Speed
Alternatively, how many times more would it take us to get from one end of the
road to another compared to driving at max. speed

SM_t*(length/max_speed)-1 <= SM_(t+1)*(length/max_speed)
What this says: the time it would take us to get from one end to another of we
got in at time t is no greater than (1 minute more than it would take us if we
enter 1 minute later)

In other words, we would get out before (or at the same time as) whomever
enters 1 minute after us.

note that we're talking about minutes here, so max_speed is in KM/minute

Now, we get (SM_t - SM_(t+1)) <= max_speed/length

Using the limits on the wavelength of the cos and sine function I've used, I've
gotten an estimate: the difference between two subsequent multipliers is no
greater than 0.04 (this is a higher bound, but not a very tight one)

And there you have it. if 0.04 is still greater than (max_speed/length),
I rescale everything to make sure It's all good.
Also, never take a multiplier smaller than 1. we don't want to drive over max.
speed, though I think the multiplier will always be > 1, this is just in case.

I actually changed it to 0.06 just in case, because the realtime thing is 
different
